# MLA: A Tool for Multi-Perspective Conformance Checking of Business Processes
Existing conformance checking techniques focus more on the controlflow
perspective rather than other aspects in a business process. This may induce
misleading conformance diagnostics. In this paper, we introduce MLA tool for
multi-perspective conformance checking. In addition to control-flow perspective,
MLA brings data and privacy perspectivesâ€™ impact into conformance analysis to
identify all intra- and inter-layer violations. Moreover, the tool can visualize the
context in which data is processed and identify where data have been processed
for unclear or secondary purposes by an authorised role. The tool has been implemented
in the open source ProM framework. The provided user interface and
graphical outputs make interpreting the conformance result simple.
